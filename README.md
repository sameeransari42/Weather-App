I’ve built a small project called "Weather App"! 🌤️ Just enter a city name to see the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

To use this project, you need an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website.
Create an account, copy your API key, and paste it into the JavaScript file where it says 'enter api'.
That's it — you're ready to go!
